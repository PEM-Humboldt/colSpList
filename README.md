# Using the colSpList API


The colSpList API (<https://colsplist.herokuapp.com>, code available at <https://github.com/marbotte/sibPlot>) provides utilities to determine whether species are alien/invasive, endemic and/or threatened on the Colombian territory.

The objective of this repository is to present some explanations and examples on how to best use the API.

It will mostly be some example code in R and python.

# Content

The folder [UsingPost](./UsingPost) contains examples concerning the Post endpoints and the API. More specifically, you will find the scripts that I used to feed the database with dataset concerning [exotic](./UsingPost/insertExotData.md), [threatened](./UsingPost/insertThreatData.md), and [endemic](./UsingPost/insertEndemData.md)
